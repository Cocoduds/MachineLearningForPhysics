Please copy the above notebook as a template for your project.

For this first project, topics covers roughly the first half of the semester and possibly involve one or more of:
* Data exploration and summary statistics
* Visualizing data
* Finding structure in data and clustering
* Kernel Density Estimation
* Bayesian Inference
* Markov Chain Monte Carlo
* Variational Inference
* Model Selection
* Artifical Neural Networks
* Supervised Learning
* Cross Validation
* Deep Neural Networks (CNNs, DNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Transformers - up to you!)
* Unsupervised Learning
* Anomaly Detection
* Accelerated AI/ML

A list of projects you can choose from are shown below:
* TBD

You are also free to suggest a project, e.g. some scientific topic that you are particularly interested in. Please contact the course instructors in advance to help you develop your project!

## *Supplemental Readings*
* None
